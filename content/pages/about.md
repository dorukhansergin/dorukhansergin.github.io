# About This Blog

My name is Dorukhan and I'm a graduate student at Arizona State University, working towards to get a PhD in Industrial Engineering.
I started this blog, mostly as a sophisticated brain dump, but also as to connect with the wider web.
I've learned so much from other people's blog (sometimes more than the papers) that I felt the need to contribute myself.
I hope my humble scribblings help someone understand and do things better.
